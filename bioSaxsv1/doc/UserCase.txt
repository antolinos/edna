   There are 3 main plugins for bio-saxs, all of them being control plugins
   _________________________________________________________________________


* EDPluginBioSaxsNormalizev1_0
Takes a 2D image (as EDF), multiplies it by a NormalisationFactor and divide it by the signal of the BeamStopDiode.

 - Wait for the input image to appear  (Uses EDPluginWaitFile from the ExecPlugins/WaitFile) 
 - Do the normalization of the raw data by ring current and BeamStopDiode (Uses the  EDPluginExecSaxsMacv1_0 from ExecPlugins/Saxs)
 - Append some information in the header related to the experiment setup (like beam position, pixel size...) 
 - Calculates the variance of each pixel and store it as a second frame 
 
* EDPluginBioSaxsAzimutIntv1_0
Does the azimuthal integration of an image into a (q,I,sigma) spectrum
 
 - Wait for the input image to appear  (Uses EDPluginWaitFile from the ExecPlugins/WaitFile) 
 - Set the dead pixels according to the mask (Uses the  EDPluginExecSaxsAddv1_0 from ExecPlugins/Saxs)
 - Does the azimuthal regrouping (Uses the EDPluginExecSaxsAnglev1_0 from ExecPlugins/Saxs)
 - convert the image generated in spec-like spectrum (Uses the  EDPluginExecSaxsCurvesv1_0 from ExecPlugins/Saxs)
 
* EDPluginBioSaxsAveragev1_0
Averages many 1D EDF images (as obtained after SaxsAngle). Variance is treated decently.

 - Wait for all input images to appear  (Uses EDPluginWaitMultiFile from the ExecPlugins/WaitFile)
 - Sums all images and divide by their number  (Uses the  EDPluginExecSaxsMacv1_0 from ExecPlugins/Saxs)
 - convert the image generated in spec-like spectrum (Uses the  EDPluginExecSaxsCurvesv1_0 from ExecPlugins/Saxs)

* EDPluginBioSaxsMetadatav1_0
Retrieves metadata from the headers of a file and mixes them with those from the XSD input.
Can update a file
   
In version 2.0 those plugins will ahve their input grouped in
