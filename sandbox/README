EDNA Sandbox
------------

As agreed at the meeting at the ESRF 20th November 2010 we need a sandbox 
where quick developments may be made in the process of making proper new 
developments.

Intentions:

 - this is a place where code for illustrating suggestions etc. can go, also 
   things for discussion.
 - when the discussion is complete the corresponding files should be removed.
 - a directory should be created which helpfully indicates what is contained
   therein - e.g. codecamp/nov10/interface_discussion/

This should be ignored by the edna plugin finding code (if a duplicate plugin is found).
