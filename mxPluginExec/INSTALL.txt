         EDNA MX execution plugins installation instructions
         ===================================================

Requirements:

 * The EDNA kernel version 1.0.1 or higher.
 
 * Python version 2.4 or later.

 * bash shell : tested on Linux, the MX execution plugins could also run on 
                different flavours of Unix (Mac OSX, FreeBSD, Solaris, HPUX, 
                IRIX etc) and maybe even on Windows however these platforms 
                have not been tested and hence are not supported.

 * The following programs must be installed in order to run all the 
   EDNA MX execution plugins:

   - MOSFLM version 7.0.5 of May 13th 2009 or later. Note that the EDNA
     MOSFLM execution plugins will _not_ work with the official CCP4 version
     of MOSFLM 7.0.4 of October 16th 2008. Please contact Harry Powell
     (harry@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk) for obtaining version 7.0.5 of May 13th. 
   
   - Labelit version 1.0 or later. The installation of Labelit is not
     required, Labelit can be used for indexing instead of MOSFLM.

   - BEST versions 3.1.0d, or 3.2.0 or later. Note that the BEST execution plugin
     will not run with version 3.1.0c. BEST can be obtained by requesting
     a licence on the BEST home web page:

         http://www.embl-hamburg.de/BEST

 * In order to take full advantage of the radiation damage prediction by 
   BEST, it is also recommended to install RADDOSE. RADDOSE
   can be obtained by contacting directly the authors: Elspeth Garman 
   (elspeth.garman@bioch.ox.ac.uk) and/or Raimond Ravelli (ravelli@embl.fr).
   We recommend to use the latest version of RADDOSE of 20090103, however
   the RADDOSE execution plugin will also work with version 2007/07/05.
   

Installation:
               
1. Untar the distribution file in a the same directory as you have installed
   the EDNA kernel. $EDNA_HOME should be set to the same value as for the
   EDNA kernel, see $EDNA_HOME/kernel/INSTALL.txt.
   
2. You must then set up a configuration file for your installation.
   The easiest solution is to copy one of the configuration files in
   the EDNA MX execution plugin distribution to a new one. 
   For example, copy

        $EDNA_HOME/mxPluginExec/conf/XSConfiguration_ESRF.xml
        
   to
   
        $EDNA_HOME/mxPluginExec/conf/XSConfiguration_yourSite.xml
   
   where you can replace yourSite with the name of your site (e.g. NSLS,
   Diamond etc). It's important to keep the "XSConfiguration_" prefix.
   The "yourSite" name is later referred to as $EDNA_SITE.
   
   Edit the XSConfiguration_yourSite.xml file, you must change the paths
   to the following programs/packages required by EDNA (we recommend
   to always use the latest versions):
   
   * bash shell script
   
   * MOSFLM version 7.0.5 of May 13th 2009 or later
   
   * LABELIT version 1.0 or later
   
   * BEST version 3.1.0, 3.2.0 or later
   
   * RADDOSE version 2007/07/05 or 2.0 of 2009/01/03 or later
   
   * CCP4 version 6.0.2 or later
   
   
 Testing the installation:

It is recommended to try to run the EDNA execution plugin test suites in order to verify
that the installation of the plugins is correct:

   * Plugin unit :      This test suite unit tests the plugins, i.e. it check methods
                        of the plugins but it doesn't execute the plugins:

        $EDNA_HOME/kernel/bin/edna-test-launcher --test EDTestSuitePluginUnitMXPluginExec
                   
                  
   * Plugin execution : This test suite tests the exeuction of all the plugins,
                        some plugins are executed several times with different input
                        data (note that test images are necessary, if they are not
                        present the script will indicate how to obtain them):

        $EDNA_HOME/kernel/bin/edna-test-launcher --test EDTestSuitePluginExecuteMXPluginExec
           
At the end of each test suite a report is presented with the number of successes / 
failures of the test suite. Each test suite should normally contain only successes.

If this is not the case check the error messages from the tests. If you cannot identify
the problem please feel free to contact the EDNA support team at edna-support@esrf.fr.
