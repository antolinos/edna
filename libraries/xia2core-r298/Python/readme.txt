Files in the Python Implementation:

Driver - the driver implementations - access through DriverFactory.Driver()
Decorators - things to "pretty up" driver instances
UnitTest - unit tests of Driver and Decorators
TestPython.py - a small script to test that the packages required by this
                module are available (when new modules are required they 
                should be added to this script)
