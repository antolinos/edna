               EDNA MXv1 installation instructions
               ===================================

Requirements:

 * The EDNA kernel version 1.0.1 or later
 
 * The EDNA MX execution plugins version 1.0.1 or later

 * Python version 2.4 or later.

Installation:

1. Untar the distribution file in a the same directory as you have installed
   the EDNA kernel and the MXv1 execution plugins. $EDNA_HOME should be set to 
   the same value as for the EDNA kernel, see $EDNA_HOME/kernel/INSTALL.txt.
   
2. You must then set up a configuration file for your installation.
   The easiest solution is to copy one of the configuration files in
   the EDNA prototype distribution to a new one. For example, copy

        $EDNA_HOME/mxv1/conf/XSConfiguration_ESRF.xml
        
   to
   
        $EDNA_HOME/mxv1/conf/XSConfiguration_yourSite.xml
   
   where you can replace yourSite with the name of your site (e.g. NSLS,
   Diamond etc). It's important to keep the "XSConfiguration_" prefix.
   The "yourSite" name is later referred to as $EDNA_SITE.
   
   Note that currently the configuration file for the MXv1 characterisation
   application must contain also the configuration for the MX execution
   plugins. Therefore all entries in 
   
      $EDNA_HOME/mxPluginExec/conf/XSConfiguration_yourSite.xml
      
   be present in 
 
      $EDNA_HOME/mxv1/conf/XSConfiguration_yourSite.xml
 
 
 3. You can then start EDNA if the $EDNA_HOME and $EDNA_SITE variables mentioned
    above have been defined with the following command:
    
       $EDNA_HOME/mxv1/bin/edna-mxv1-characterisation
       
    In order to avoid having to define these variables you can easily create an
    EDNA prototype startup script:
    
    #!/bin/bash
    export EDNA_HOME=[path to your edna directory, e.g. /usr/local/xtal/edna]
    export EDNA_SITE=[name of your site, e.g. NSLS, Diamond etc]
    $EDNA_HOME/mxv1/bin/edna-mxv1-characterisation $*


Testing the installation:

It is recommended to try to run the EDNA MXv1 test suites in order to verify
that the installation of the prototype is correct:

   * Plugin unit :      This test suite unit tests the plugins, i.e. it check methods
                        of the plugins but it doesn't execute the plugins:
                   
        $EDNA_HOME/kernel/bin/edna-test-launcher --test EDTestSuitePluginUnitMXv1
                  
   * Plugin execution : This test suite tests the exeuction of all the plugins,
                        some plugins are executed several times with different input
                        data (note that test images are necessary, if they are not
                        present the script will indicate how to obtain them):

        $EDNA_HOME/kernel/bin/edna-test-launcher --test EDTestSuitePluginExecuteMXv1
           
At the end of each test suite a report is presented with the number of successes / 
failures of the test suite. Each test suite should normally contain only successes.

If this is not the case check the error messages from the tests. If you cannot identify
the problem please feel free to contact the EDNA support team at edna-support@esrf.fr.
