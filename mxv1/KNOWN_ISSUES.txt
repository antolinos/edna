          Known issues with EDNA MXv1 version 1.0.1
		  =========================================

* Pilatus detector format is not yet supported (bug #52)

* A shorter summary from the MXv1 characterisation application must be
  implemented, especially for the ccp4i GUI log output (bug #313)

* The edna_mxv1_characterisation ccp4i GUI does not work correctly when
  using CCP4 version 6.1.1 (i.e. ccp4i version higher that 2.0), some
  of the output files can not be accessed from the GUI. This bug has
  already been fixed in the development version and thus will be fixed
  in the next minor release of the EDNA MXv1 Characterisation application.
