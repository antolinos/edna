Dimple
------

This is the joint Diamond / CCP4 pipeline to be treated as a kind of "spike"
for testing out how well CCP4 applications get on with the EDNA framework. 
As such, it has no version number, as the following conclusions are possible:

 - we will learn enough from this to move to a full CCP4 v1 application
 - we will give up with the pipeline
 - we will develop it as a useful application but not develop it too much more

This means that there should not be a dimplev2, so dimplev1 is not needed.

Why Dimple?
