Changes to make to dimplev0 prior to extension.
-----------------------------------------------

Rename - pdbfile, mtzfile to xyz, hkl. InputPDBFile -> XYZIN, HKLIN &c.

Then add scope for additional information in these objects - 

hkl:
  file
  columns:
    name, label

so for instance, for the truncate plugin:

hklin:
  fast_dp.mtz
  columns:
    i = I
    sigi = SIGI
    etc.

Additional Exec Plugins
-----------------------

 - Pointless for xyzin, hklin to reindex for different indexing origin
 - Pointless (or other) for spacegroup assignment
 - Molecular replacement (e.g. with Phaser) 

-- example script for identical molecular replacement --

  phaser << eof
  mode mr_auto
  hklin f.mtz
  labin F=F SIGF=SIGF
  ensemble model pdb 2VHK.pdb identity 100
  composition protein mw 25600 num 1
  search ensemble model num 1
  root mr
  eof




Additional Control Plugins
--------------------------

 - Pointless decide indexing
 - Select right pdb file
 - Chose to do MR or RB
 - Runner of MR




Port to Windows 


Dimple V2
---------

Two pipelines: dimple_mr and dimple_ms (molecular replacement and molecular
substitution i.e. difference map)

Overall dimple pipeline: 

input: hklin
       xyzin list
       [spacegroup] * assumed to be the same as the selected pdb if not set

phase 1: select pdb file
         for each xyzin in xyzin_list:
             if pointgroup(xyzin) != pointgroup(hklin)
                 continue
             if cell(xyzin) ~ cell(hklin):
                 select
             else
                 test with pointless; reindex; compare cell

         if len(selected) == 0:
             dimple_mr(xyzin_list[0], spacegroup)
         elif len(selected) == 1:
             dimple_ms(xyzin_list[0])
         else:
             raise error?

dimple_ms pipeline is much like we already have, with pointless reindexing 
added.

dimple_mr is almost the same as current pipeline with spacegroup assigned 
as input (or searched for or guessed) and phaser mr in place of refmac 
rigid body refinement.
