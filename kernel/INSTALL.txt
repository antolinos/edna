               EDNA kernel installation instructions
               =====================================

Requirements:

 * Python version 2.4 or later.

Installation:
               
   Untar the distribution file in a suitable location on your file system,
   for example /usr/local/xtal. The directory "edna" created in this
   location is later referred to as $EDNA_HOME, e.g. in the example above
   $EDNA_HOME should be set to: /usr/local/xtal/edna.
      
Testing the installation:

It is recommended to test the EDNA kernel test suite in order to verify
that the installation of the kernel is correct. After setting EDNA_HOME, 
use this command for starting the kernel test suite:

  $EDNA_HOME/kernel/bin/edna-test-launcher --test EDTestSuiteKernel

At the end of the test suite you should see the following text:

  [UnitTest]: ###################################################################
  [UnitTest]: EDTestSuiteKernel summary report:
  [UnitTest]:                      Total TestCases: 6
  [UnitTest]:            Total TestCases [SUCCESS]: 6
  [UnitTest]:               Total TestCases [FAIL]: 0
  [UnitTest]:                  [Total TestMethods]: 16
           
If this is not the case check the error messages from the tests. If you cannot identify
the problem please feel free to contact the EDNA support team at edna-support@esrf.fr.
