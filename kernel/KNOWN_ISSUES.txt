		  ===========================================

* The configuration of the size of action clusters should be implemented in
  EDPluginControl (bug #95)
  
* The path of some of the output files from EDNA can become too long for the
  NTFS disks (bug #261)
  
* There's no check that the EDNA_HOME environment variable actually points
  to a valid EDNA installation (bug #273)
  
* The tests suites should create an unique top directory where all the tests
  run by the suite are stored (bug #304)
  
* The command line parsing of the EDApplication must be improved, for example
  --help does not work (bug #309)
  
* The EDApplication log file is stored in the current working directory and
  not in --basedir (bug #310)
