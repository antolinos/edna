This is an execution plugin for EDNA which transforms 
a set (of dozens) of images (PNG or JPEG) into a video stream (.avi)

The default configuration uses the MsMpeg4v2 codec as  provided by 
mplayer and mencoder at a framerate of 25 images/sec and a bitrate 
of 800 kbit/s.

Even if MsMpeg4v2 is far from the quality of an h264, this codec is 
pretty efficient even on elder computer and its biggest advantage is 
that it is NATIVELY compatible with microsoft windows XP (and probably newer)
